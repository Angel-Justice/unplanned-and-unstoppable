          <h3>From Chaos to Strategy</h3>
          <p>When I stumbled into the world of survivor empowerment in 2019,
            little did I know how my life would change. Armed
            with nothing but curiosity and maybe a little chaos, I didn't fully
            understand what I was getting into. What started as spontaneous "why
            not?" turned into a journey that changed everything. I found my tribe,
            we had purpose and power to make the change we wanted to see. From
            parliament to the people, we continue to engage in a thoughtful way, and with purpose
            to win hearts and minds. Our movement is built with compassion and
            kindness at the forefront. We share the stories behind the slogans and
            every small win shapes our next move. So, what next? A new adventure awaits.

          <p>They say justice is blind, but I know it can see;<br>It just turns its back
            when it's someone like me.<br>No papers in order, no lawyers to spare,<br>
            Just forms lost in systems that pretend to care.<br> <br>
            I wait in a limbo you built, brick by brick,<br>Delays by design, each
            moment makes me sick.<br>From shouting for fairness in rooms built for
            'No.'<br>Profits from my pain; this system is cold.<br> <br>
            How much more must I endure?<br>I'm stuck in a queue
            with locks at both ends.<br>If healing is slow and justice unclear,<br>Then
            let this be known: I am still here.<br>

          <p>
            Where every click carries the potential to spark change. Notifications aren't
            just a ping on your screen, they're the new call to action, a way of
            connecting people to causes that matter. Social media has turned
            campaigning into a living, breathing conversation where engagement is
            instant. Each interaction, tap or share adds to the momentum. At the end,
            the power of a campaign isn't measured in likes or impressions, but in
            the hearts and minds moved by a single meaningful click.
